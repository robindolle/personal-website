# Personal Website

My personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The base theme is [Hello Friend NG](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/), with some little edits by me. You can find the repository of the built static website [here](https://github.com/robindolle/robindolle.github.io).
